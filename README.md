# Forecasting Weekly Demand for Individual Grocery Items

A local food distribution company buys produce from local farms and then distributes to wholesalers, upscale restaurants, grocery stores, and individuals. This company habitually over and under stocks their goods because they do not have an inventory demand forecast model. Buying decisions are mainly made by gut or innate industry knowledge. There is currently no systematic, data-driven stocking approach in place.
